    <string name="Philippines">The PHILIPPINES are an island group of over 7,500 islands;
        the main islands are Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Leyte, Samar, Negros and Panay.
        Most of the Philippine islands are of volcanic origin. The archipelago is
        situated within the Southeast Asian part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area
        of intense volcanic and seismic activities. Along the eastern side of the islands
        runs the Philippine Trench, a submarine trench in the floor of the Philippine Sea. The Galathea
        Depth within the underwater canyon is one of the deepest depths of the ocean at
        10,540m (34,580 feet)</string>
